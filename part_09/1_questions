1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?

Byte streams read one byte at a time, while character streams read 16-bit characters.


2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?

FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, DataInputStream


3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?

InputStreamReader, FileReader, BufferedReader


4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?

It is a statement that automatically closes an input stream, and it's useful because it is concise and you can't forget
to close an input stream.


5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

try (FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(args[0]))


6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?

a byte of data from the input stream


7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)

A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system. What files are available depends on the host environment.

FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader.


8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?

bytes


9) What is a BufferedReader?

a character input stream that can store multiple characters in its buffer


10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?

InputStreamReader is needed to convert the byte stream into a character stream.


11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?

It turns them into characters.


12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?

read() reads a single character while readLine() reads an entire line.


13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("yucatan_cenotes.txt"));
