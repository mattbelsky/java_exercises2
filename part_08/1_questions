1) Describe the exception hierarchy.

Throwable (class)

 |                                      \

Exception                               Error

 |                                       \

ExceptionSubClasses                     RuntimeException


2) What is a try/catch statement?

The code inside the try statement tries to run unless an error is thrown within it. Catch catches the error and executes
the code within the catch statement.


3) Why do we use try/catch statements?

To prevent exceptions from crashing the program.


4) Write a full example of a try/catch/finally statement that catches two distinct exceptions

try {
    // code that generates exceptions
}
catch (ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType2 e) {
    // handles the exception that was caught
}


5) What does it mean to "throw" an exception? How does it work?

In this context it means manually generating one by using the "throw" keyword and passing it an object.


6) What happens if your application encounters an exception and you don't catch it or throw it?

It crashes.


7) When catching exception in an inheritance hierarchy, should you catch the subclass exception or the
superclass exception first? Why?

Subclass exceptions should be caught first because if superclass exceptions are caught first, the subclass ones will
become unreachable.


8) Write a nested try/catch statement.

try {
    try {
        // code to try
    }
    catch (// Exception) {
        // handles exception
    }
}
catch (// Exception) {
    // handles exception
}


9) What does it mean to rethrow an exception?

catching an exception in an inner try/catch and throwing it to the outer one for it to deal with


10) What are the 7 methods that come with the Throwable class?

fillinStackTrace()
getLocalizedMessage()
getMessage()
printStackTrace()
printStackTrace(PrintStream stream)
printStackTrace(PrintWriter stream)
String toString()


11) What does the "finally" block do?

executes code that you want executed after an exception is generated


12) When is the finally block executed? Will it ever not be executed?

when code execution exits the try/catch block; no


13) What are the three recently added features to Java exceptions?

automatic resources management
try-with-resources statement
final rethrow / more precise rethrow
