1) What is Java inheritance?

a hierarchy of classes in which subclasses take on the properties of superclasses


2) How does inheritance work?

Superclasses are instantiated first, then subclasses. Subclasses can access superclass instance variables and methods
from superclasses.


3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?

supports encapsulation, cleaner & more organized code


4) What does the "super" keyword do?

calls instance variables & methods in the superclass


5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?

superclass -> subclass -> subclass


6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?

The method code in a subclass is called than that in the superclass.


7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?

They allow a method to take different forms depending on the need.


8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?

Overloaded: The same method can take on additional or different arguments
Overridden: The method sharing the same name in a superclass takes on a different form in the subclass


9) What is dynamic method dispatch?

It is a mechanism that allows overridden methods to be resolved at runtime rather than compile time as the method is
called depending on the type of object being referred to rather than the type of reference variable.

10) What does the "final" keyword do?

It prevents an instance variable or method from being overridden.


11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?

Object
